    <p>Low-carbon life refers to the adoption of day to day activities that help reduce carbon emission. Scientists attribute high emission of greenhouse gases to human activities. For example, the burning of fossil fuel to make electricity leads to carbon dioxide emission in the atmosphere. As such, using electricity is an activity that contributes to an increase in carbon in the air. In this light, low-carbon life is a lifestyle geared towards minimizing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (Dubois et al. 147). By contrast, global warming refers to an increase in average global temperature. Therefore, Low-carbon life is related to global warming, considering that it helps reduce the emission of gases that trap the heat. Undoubtedly, low-carbon life contributes to the reduction of carbon dioxide and other air pollutants that absorb solar radiation and hence help mitigate global warming.</p>

    <p>Low-carbon life is an essential step towards the reduction of carbon gases in the atmosphere. It is worth noting that greenhouse gases serve as natures blanket because they are used for climate regulation. However, their increase in the atmosphere gives rise to the retention of solar radiation which in turn causes climate change. Although embracing low-carbon life might be perceived as a little effort, it is essential because it promotes a clean environment and healthy living (Luderer et al. 7). High consumption leads to high emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses. As such, low-carbon life can be promoted by low consumption in every sphere of human life.</p>

    <p>First of all, a low-carbon life can be promoted by healthy eating. Arguably, food accounts for 20% of greenhouse gas emission from the time it grows to the point it is placed on the plate (Merino et al. 5066). Therefore, there are different ways in which eating habits and choice of food can enhance low-carbon life. For instance, the purchase of local food products helps save energy used in transportation and preservation. In the same fashion, using organic food as well as seasonal food leads to a reduction of fertilizers, chemical pesticides and energy that is used in greenhouses. Similarly, the use of natural products with minimal processing and packaging leads to low carbon usage. Also, the consumption of more fruits and vegetables rather than animal products, and cooking with simple methods encourage low-carbon life.</p>

    <p>Secondly, the adoption of low energy consumption practices in homes and offices promotes low-carbon life. Often, individuals utilize different products to improve hygiene standards in homes and offices. Notably, embracing good habits not only enhance health but conserve the environment as well. For example, selection of detergents and soaps made from natural ingredients minimizes exposure to chemical elements. Likewise, making good use of natural light by opening windows to allow air circulation saves the energy that is otherwise used in air conditioners and electrical light (Merino et al. 5066). Furthermore, choosing appliances with higher energy efficiency and switching off electrical devices that are unused or in standby mode reduces generation and emission of carbon gases. Lastly, recycling electrical equipment and reuse of containers is a step towards low-carbon life. </p>

    <p>Thirdly, low-carbon life can be promoted through travel activities. Scientists argue that the transport sector accounts for a significant amount of carbon and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Therefore, the use of public transport such as buses and trains helps to curb emissions. Additionally, the use of bicycles or walking for short distances is not only a healthy practice but free from emissions as well. Use of environmental friendly petrol cars and turning off the engines of idle vehicles also helps reduce the amount of carbon gases released from vehicles. Altogether, engaging in activities that involve low energy consumption promotes low-carbon life. </p>
