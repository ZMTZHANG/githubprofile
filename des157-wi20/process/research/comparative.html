    <p>User interfaces are becoming increasingly important by the day. Research shows that people no more want to read through lengthy texts to find the content, but rather just want to skip through and in a few seconds get a glimpse of what they are looking for. The user interfaces of some companies present a very poor user experience that the customers just want to throw their mobile devices and their computers away. This is because of the little work that has gone into ensuring that the customer has a wonderful user experience while exploring the mobile app or the web app of the company. Studies show that users tend to interact more with user interfaces that are welcoming and engaging with regards to rich graphics, preciseness and simplicity, as opposed to dull graphics and complex user interfaces.</p>

    <p>For these reasons, companies ought to find ways in which they can boost the user experience when consumers use their mobile app. A customer who loves a user interface is more likely to visit the site or use the app multiple times because of the wonderful experience they had, as opposed to if the customer had found a poor user interface. One such company that has been successful in designing an engaging, simple and easy to use user interface is Facebook and Facebook.</p>

    <p> Facebook provides a very simple and easy to use user interface. A user interacting with the app can navigate with great ease to the desired activity. This is because of the minimal amount of icons in the interface. These icons are conspicuous and spaced out so it is easy to find them when one just skim through the app. On the other hand, although the icons are not evenly spaced out in Facebook mobile app, the app presents interactive graphics that offer shortcuts whenever you place a cursor on top of an icon. With regards to collecting information from users, Facebook is very precise and asks for only the fundamentally important details from the user. For example, when the Facebook mobile app offers a client the chance to create an account with just a phone number or email address. The information they are collecting about the customer is straight to the point and written “First name, Last name, Email and Password”. In comparison, the Facebook mobile app also does a good job of presenting clarity and precision when collecting user information using forms. For example, when the company offers a user the opportunity to create user account, the company clearly indicates the text boxes for the six user requirements, email address, first name, last name, phone number, city and invite code.</p>

    <p>Facebook has overwhelmingly limited content and presented only the most important aspects that an average user may need in their site at the homepage and provides a wonderful navigation of the website. Contrary to this, the Uber app does not provide limited content but does a great job of providing junk of information to users.  </p>

    <p>Comparably, I believe that Facebook has done a great job of providing simple and easy navigation of the website. However, the Uber app creates a great emotional impact on the user with great pictures and graphics of the products they offer. Facebook could do better by including better graphics in its interface and Uber could improve its mobile app user experience by limiting content.  </p>

    <p>The collection of information by the Uber app is simple and precise. After logging on to the app, the first thing that you notice is the sign up interface. It’s conspicuous, and easy to use. The textboxes provided are clearly labelled, email, First Name, Last Name, Phone, Create Password, City and an optional invite code. Generally, the forms are well designed and easy t use.  </p>

    <p>In addition, there is limited content at the Uber app. Having a lot of content inhibits readability and users may have a bad experience in navigating the webpage. Furthermore, users always want or need to go straight to what they are looking for. The precise information that is provided by the Uber app creates an outstanding experience for the customer. </p>

    <p>The Uber app also provides choices to let users prioritize their own pathways through content. There are a lot of navigation tools and links that are provided by the Uber app where a user can easily navigate the app. Clues are also provided to functionality and users are oriented to how elements of the interface function. In comparison to Facebook, Uber offers a better customer experience compared to Facebook and other apps. These projects make me feel that apps ought to concentrate on making the user experience great. Uber and Facebook apps are very effective.  </p>
